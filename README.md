## CUDA Ray Tracer

A Ray Tracer written by following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview). Used cuda to parallelise the ray tracer and make it faster.

While this provides a considerable speedup in comparison to the previous serial execution, it can definitely be faster (It was my first cuda program).

## TODO:
- [ ] Add documentation and clean up code
- [ ] Make it faster :, )
- [ ] Add progress indicator
- [ ] Ray Tracing the Next Week.
